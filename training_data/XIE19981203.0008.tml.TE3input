<TEXT>BRUSSELS, December 2 (Xinhua) --

The ratification process of NATO enlargement concluded on Wednesday after the Netherlands gave its go-ahead.

Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have been accepted as members of the Western military alliance after the upper house of the Dutch parliament voted in favor of their inclusion.

All the political parties in the upper house, with the exception of the Greens, agreed on the enlargement process, according to reports reaching here.

The lower house already approved the enlargement move in early October this year.

The ratification process began in February this year with Canada being the first NATO member state starting the ratification process.

It was followed by Denmark, Norway, Germany, France, Greece, Luxembourg, Spain, Britain, the United States, Iceland, Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Turkey.

NATO decided at last year's Madrid summit to invite the three eastern European countries to start accession talks.

Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are scheduled to become full members of NATO in April next year when the alliance celebrates its 50th anniversary in Washington.</TEXT>

Paper was <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e0">invented</EVENT> in ancient China during the Han Dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD) and spread slowly to the west via the Silk Road. Papermaking and manufacturing in Europe was <EVENT class="ASPECTUAL" eid="e1">started</EVENT> by Muslims <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e2">living</EVENT> on the Iberian Peninsula, (<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE">today</TIMEX3>'s Portugal and Spain) and Sicily in the 10th century, and slowly <EVENT class="STATE" eid="e3">spread</EVENT> to Italy and Southern France <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e4">reaching</EVENT> Germany by <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE">1400</TIMEX3>. Earlier, other paper-like materials were in <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e5">use</EVENT> including papyrus, parchment, palm leaves and vellum, but all of these were <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e6">derived</EVENT> from <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e7">raw</EVENT> materials which were expensive or in limited supply, or required <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e8">extensive</EVENT> hand-processing to <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e9">produce</EVENT> a satisfactory finish. Paper, being made from wood or rags, could be produced anywhere, and once large scale <EVENT class="STATE" eid="e10">production</EVENT> techniques had been developed it could be manufactured in almost any quantity at moderate cost.

In medieval Europe, the hitherto handcraft of papermaking was <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e11">mechanized</EVENT> by the <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e12">use</EVENT> of waterpower, the first water papermill in the Iberian Peninsula having been <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e13">built</EVENT> in the Portuguese city of Leiria in 1411, and other processes. The rapid <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e14">expansion</EVENT> of European paper production was truly enhanced by the <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e15">invention</EVENT> of the printing press and the beginning of the Printing Revolution in the 15th century.

The word "paper" is etymologically derived from papyros, Ancient Greek for the Cyperus papyrus plant. Papyrus is a thick, paper-like material produced from the pith of the Cyperus papyrus plant which was <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e16">used</EVENT> in ancient Egypt and other Mediterranean cultures for writing long before the making of paper in China. Papyrus however is a "<EVENT class="STATE" eid="e17">lamination</EVENT> of natural plants, while paper is manufactured from fibres whose properties have <EVENT class="STATE" eid="e18">been</EVENT> <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e19">changed</EVENT> by maceration or disintegration.

Early papermaking in China.

Papermaking has traditionally been <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e20">traced</EVENT> to China when Cai Lun, an official attached to the Imperial court during the Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 220), created a sheet of paper using mulberry and other bast fibres along with fishnets, old rags, and hemp waste, though the earliest piece of paper found, at Fangmatan in Gansu province <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e21">inscribed</EVENT> with a map, dates from 179-41 BC.

Techniques.

During the Shang (1600 - <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE">1050</TIMEX3> BC) and Zhou (1050-256 BC) dynasties of ancient China, documents were ordinarily <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e22">written</EVENT> on bone or bamboo (on tablets or on bamboo strips sewn and <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e23">rolled</EVENT> together into <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e24">scrolls</EVENT>), making them very heavy, awkward, and hard to <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e25">transport</EVENT>. The light material of silk was sometimes <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e26">used</EVENT>, but was normally too expensive to consider. While the Han Dynasty Chinese court official Cai Lun is widely regarded to have invented the modern method of papermaking (inspired from wasps and bees) from rags and other plant fibers in AD 105, the discovery of specimens bearing written Chinese characters in 2006 at north-east China's Gansu province <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e27">suggest</EVENT> that paper was in use by the ancient Chinese military more than 100 years before Cai, in 8 BC. It therefore would appear that "Cai Lun's contribution was to improve this skill systematically and scientifically, fixing a recipe for papermaking".

The record in the standard history <EVENT class="REPORTING" eid="e28">says</EVENT>

The manufacture may have originated from the <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e29">practice</EVENT> of pounding and stirring rags in water, after which the <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e30">matted</EVENT> fibres were <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e31">collected</EVENT> on a mat. The bark of Paper Mulberry was particularly <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e32">valued</EVENT> and high quality paper was <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e33">developed</EVENT> in the late Han <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE">period</TIMEX3>, which used the bark of the than wood. In the Eastern Jin period paper began to be <EVENT class="STATE" eid="e34">made</EVENT> on a fine bamboo screen-mould, <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e35">treated</EVENT> with insecticidal dye for permanence. After <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e36">printing</EVENT> <EVENT class="STATE" eid="e37">became</EVENT> popular in the Song dynasty the <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e38">demand</EVENT> <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e39">grew</EVENT> more. Paper was often <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e40">used</EVENT> as a levy, with one prefecture <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e41">sending</EVENT> some 1.5m sheets of paper to the capital as tribute up to the year 1101.

Uses.

The first <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e42">use</EVENT> of paper has been <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e43">excavated</EVENT> in China dating to the reign of Emperor Wu of Han from the 2nd century BC, used for purposes of <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e44">wrapping</EVENT> or <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e45">padding</EVENT> protection for delicate bronze mirrors. It was also <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e46">used</EVENT> for safety, such as the padding of poisonous 'medicine' as mentioned in the official history of the period. Although paper used for writing became widespread by the 3rd century <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e47">AD</EVENT>, paper <EVENT class="ASPECTUAL" eid="e48">continued</EVENT> to be <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e49">used</EVENT> for wrapping (and other) purposes. Toilet paper was <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e50">used</EVENT> in China from around 875 C.E. In 589, the Chinese scholar-official Yan Zhitui (531-591) wrote: "Paper on which there are quotations or commentaries from Five Classics or the names of sages, I dare not use for toilet purposes". An Arab traveler to China once <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e51">wrote</EVENT> of the curious Chinese tradition of toilet paper in 851, writing: "...they [the Chinese] do not wash themselves with water when they have <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e52">done</EVENT> <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e53">their</EVENT> <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e54">necessities</EVENT>; but they only wipe themselves with paper".

During the Tang Dynasty (618 - 907) paper was <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e55">folded</EVENT> and <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e56">sewn</EVENT> into <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e57">square</EVENT> bags to preserve the flavor of tea. During the same <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE">period</TIMEX3>, it was written that tea was served from baskets with multi-colored paper cups and paper napkins of different size and shape. During the Chinese Song Dynasty (960 - 1279) not only did the government produce the world's first known paper-printed money, or banknote (see Jiaozi and Huizi), but paper money bestowed as gifts to deserving government officials were wrapped in special paper envelopes.

Diffusion of paper.

After its origin in central China, the production and use of paper spread steadily. It is clear that paper was <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e58">used</EVENT> at Dunhuang by AD 150, in Loulan in the modern-day province of Xinjiang by 200, and in Turpan by 399. Paper was concurrently <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e59">introduced</EVENT> in Japan sometime between the years 280 and 610.
